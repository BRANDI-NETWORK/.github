## 💬 What Is Brandi?

We’re building the interface between **ambition** and **execution**.

## 🌍 Why It Matters

> Entrepreneurs don’t need another AI chatbot.  
> They need a **strategy engine** that speaks their language.

Most AI systems are built for engineers. Brandi is built for business builders — solopreneurs, coaches, freelancers, and small brands who want speed and structure without writing code.

We’re closing the gap between idea and visibility.
